Commit Message Guidelines
=========================

Follow GNOME's commit message guidelines:
 https://wiki.gnome.org/Git/CommitMessages

To these rules we add some others.

General rules:
- in the description, try to fill as much as possible your lines (don't
  go to the line if the next word can fit),
- don't go to the line after a sentence except of course if you cant add
  words after,
- split paragraphs with two newlines (one empty line),
- if the context isn't sufficient, be explicit with the types and the
  namespaces of the codepoints you cite,
- suffix methods and functions with parentheses (without the space) so
  when reading we know the name refers to an operation,
- write property names between single quotes and in kebab-case.

The actual changes:
- the first paragraph explains what the commit does from an objective
  point of view: the code change,
- if the shortlog is explicit enough, this first paragraph can be
  omitted,
- try to start sentences by the action performed, try to use the
  infinitive.

The reasoning behind the changes:
- the second paragraph explains what the commit does from a subjective
  point of view: the behavior change,
- don't write about what was before this commit, write about what this
  commit does.
